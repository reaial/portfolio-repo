# portfolio-repo
 This is going to be the repository that I use in order to show the progress over the next month or so creating my portfolio website.

 This website will house my creative work. From my graphic design, to my videography. I am using Github to also show my ability to develop a website, so that there is not only the website to show off my creative work, but this will also show my web development capabilities to employers as well.
