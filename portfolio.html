  <p>Hi there, and welcome to my creative portfolio. I do everything from UX design to filmmaking. While I am still new at all of this I began this journey over a year ago now. I am well versed in video editing and shooting. I also thrive at content creation and have been doing so for a year for a NCAA Gymnastics team. Which is why I created this website in order to showcase these talents. I hope that you will enjoy the showcase of my works and come back as the page advances and my talents progress. </p>

   <p>I took these images that you see on your left with a Canon XS Rebel 7. I have a passion for showing off the beauty that is in the simpliest things, which is why all of these photos are stripped down to just the subject(s) and who they are as people. </p>
